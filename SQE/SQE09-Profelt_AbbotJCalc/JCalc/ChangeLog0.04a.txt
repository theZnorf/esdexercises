JCalc v0.04a Change Log
=======================


Cleaned up Code:
	
	--No longer imports javax.swing.event.* package unnecessarily
	--Took out unnecessary On/Off button (useless feature added for learning purposes)
	--Took out all code regarding the On/Off function (including unecessary boolean that was taking up space in CalulatorFrame inner class)
