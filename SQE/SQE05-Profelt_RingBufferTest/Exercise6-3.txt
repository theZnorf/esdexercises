        tests:              90.7 %
        application code:   41   %
    
    the coverage of the application code excluding the tests is lower than the
    projects coverage because the tests does show a greater coverage for
    branches and instructions

    yes the results differ, due to different execution paths with or without
    active connection, potential problems would be if only one of the cases
    is tested and the application code crashes in some situation of the other
    case

    including multiple classes in a testcase of a specific class can be
    problematic due to possible misinterpreted testresults e.g. when the failure
    is caused by additional classes and not by the tested class.
    this could lead to an overseen broken code within the tested class.
